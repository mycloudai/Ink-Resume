A concise and efficient online resume editor. It uses Markdown syntax, allowing you to create professional, beautiful, and print-friendly resumes with simple text markup. It supports real-time preview, multi-language switching, and rich custom printing options.

## ✨ Features

*   **Real-time Preview**: Type on the left, and instantly see the rendered resume on the right.
*   **Markdown Support**: Use simple and intuitive Markdown syntax (e.g., `###` for headings, `-` for lists) to format your resume content.
*   **Rich Print Settings**: Before printing, you can freely adjust page margins, overall scaling, title/content font sizes, and line height to achieve the best A4 print layout.
*   **Multi-language Support**: Built-in support for both Chinese and English UI and default templates, switchable with a single click.
*   **Data Import/Export**: Export your resume content to a `.yaml` file for backup, or restore from a file, making migration and version control easy.
*   **Drag & Drop Sorting**: Freely reorder sections like "Education" and "Work Experience" by dragging and dropping.
